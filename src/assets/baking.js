The food coloring really helped make the cookie dough come to life and I thought I was making my own bakery with these. It actually felt like I was playing around with play dough instead of cookie dough because of the vibrant colors. It's super fun to make! ",

            "Before we start on this recipe, just wanted to catch up with you guys. SO, how you beeeen? how you holding up? Everything is going by so fast lately its incrediblle. I've been seeing major changes in the world and it's really chaotic. I get that the corona virus is a hot topic right now and alot of people are concerned about it. I've seen social media the past month and it's not that surprising that all the cleaning products like toilet paper, laundry detergants, and canned foods are running low stock. I don't blame the people for buying toiletries and perishables ahead of time, but there are families that are suffering with the virus right now and need the supplies more than we do. I know my words aren't going to chance much but I just want to tell you my position in all of this. I think it's ridiculous. We have to remind ourselves that in times of crisis, we need to be cooperative with one another and be nice to each other as well. I end with that note.",
            "Anyways, back to the recipe. I had chocolate hershey's kisses at my house and thought that that maybe I can bake this into something. I searched up different recipes and I found that this is the easiest way to use hershey's kisses. This brownie recipe looks like a cupcake at first but it only seems that way because of the cupcake liners. I promise you this is a brownie LOL.",
